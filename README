			 General Information

This is spatial_domain_toolbox, a collection of matlab functions
and scripts written by Gunnar Farnebäck. Originally this contained
implementations of some of the algorithms described in his Ph.D. thesis
"Polynomial Expansion for Orientation and Motion Estimation" but has
subsequently been extended with other algorithms. A common theme is
that the algorithms work on multidimensional signals and are designed
and used directly in the spatial (or spatiotemporal) domain, without
involving e.g. Fourier or wavelet transforms. Some functions even more
generally apply to  multidimensional arrays. 

Download instructions for the latest version should be available at

			    Prerequisites

In order for this toolbox to be useful, you need to have Matlab
installed. The toolbox has been tested with Matlab 7.


			     Installation

Clone the repository and add the directory to the Matlab search path.
You also need to compile the C mex files. This is most easily done by
running the following code in the toolbox directory:

files = dir();
for name = {files.name}
    file = name{1};
    if file(end) == 'c' && file(end-1) == '.'
        mex(file);
    end
end

			 Further Development

At this point it is unlikely that more new algorithms or functions
will be added. Bugfixes may still appear.
Development versions are available at GitHub,
https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/spatial_domain_toolbox

The previously used subversion repository at
http://lsvn.lysator.liu.se/svnroot/spatial_domain_toolbox/trunk
has been closed.


			     Bug Reports

Please send bug reports, bug fixes, improvements, and success stories
to the author at gunnar@lysator.liu.se. The toolbox is of course
provided as is, no warranty, etc.
