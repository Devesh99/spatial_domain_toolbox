			 General Information

This is spatial_domain_toolbox-2.0, a collection of matlab functions
and scripts implementing some of the algorithms described in
"Polynomial Expansion for Orientation and Motion Estimation", the
Ph.D. thesis of Gunnar Farnebäck. The latest version should always be
available at http://www.isy.liu.se/~gf/software/.

Author is Gunnar Farnebäck, gf@isy.liu.se.

			    Prerequisites

In order for this toolbox to be useful, you need to have Matlab
installed. The toolbox has been tested with Matlab 5.3.


			     Installation

Untar the archive and copy all files to a directory where Matlab can
find them. You also need to compile the C mex files. This is most
easily done by running the following code in the toolbox directory:

files = dir();
for name = {files.name}
    file = name{1};
    if file(end) == 'c' && file(end-1) == '.'
        mex(file);
    end
end


			      References

The Ph.D. thesis, as well as a number of related papers, can be
found at either of these pages:

http://www.isy.liu.se/~gf/publications.html
http://lmi.bwh.harvard.edu/papers/gunnar.html

			 Further Development

Some missing algorithms from the Ph.D. thesis are planned for
inclusion in later versions of the toolbox.


			     Bug Reports

Please send bug reports, bug fixes, improvements, and success stories
to the author at gf@isy.liu.se. The toolbox is of course provided as
is, no warranty, etc.
