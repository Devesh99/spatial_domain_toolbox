			 General Information

This is spatial_domain_toolbox-1.1, a collection of matlab functions
and scripts implementing some of the algorithms described in "Spatial
Domain Methods for Orientation and Velocity Estimation", the
licentiate thesis by Gunnar Farnebäck. The latest version should
always be available at http://www.isy.liu.se/~gf/software/

Author is Gunnar Farnebäck, gf@isy.liu.se.

			    Prerequisites

In order for this toolbox to be useful, you need to have Matlab
installed.


			     Installation

Untar the archive and copy all files to a directory where Matlab can
find them. You also need to compile the C mex files, which can be done
by running "mex conv3.c", and similarly for the other C files, from a
shell or from inside Matlab.


			      References

The licentiate thesis, as well as a number of related papers, can be
found at

http://www.isy.liu.se/~gf/publications.html

In particular, the algorithms included in version 1.0 of the toolbox
mostly cover what is presented in the paper "Fast and Accurate Motion
Estimation using Orientation Tensors and Parametric Motion Models"
(ICPR 2000) and "Very High Accuracy Velocity Estimation using
Orientation Tensors, Parametric Motion, and Simultaneous Segmentation
of the Motion Field" (ICCV 01).


			 Further Development

Missing algorithms from the licentiate thesis are planned for
inclusion in later versions of the toolbox.


			     Bug Reports

Please send bug reports, bug fixes, improvements, and success stories
to the author at gf@isy.liu.se. The toolbox is of course provided as
is, no warranty, etc.
